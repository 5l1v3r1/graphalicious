# Graphalicious

This will be a tremendously beautiful graphing API.

# Dependencies

# TODO

 * Implement a system for showing externally defined views (i.e. loading and error panes) inside the graph canvas's bounds.
 * Create test content which has built-in lag and random errors.
 * Create a basic error pane and loading pane.
 * Implement BaseStage *somehow*
