# Graphalicious

This will be a tremendously beautiful graphing API.

# Dependencies

This depends on [crystal](https://github.com/unixpickle/crystal).

# Building

You must have [jsbuild](https://github.com/unixpickle/jsbuild) installed in order to use the build script.

# TODO

 * Make everything asynchronous:
   * Content should asynchronously return a ContentPiece which is synchronous.
   * The graph will scroll a ContentPiece until the new ContentPiece is loaded.
