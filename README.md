# Graphalicious

This will be a tremendously beautiful graphing API.

# Dependencies

This depends on [crystal](https://github.com/unixpickle/crystal), [eventemitter.js](https://github.com/unixpickle/eventemitter.js), and [scroller.js](https://github.com/unixpickle/scroller.js).

This also uses the window.requestAnimationFrame API.

# Building

You must have [jsbuild](https://github.com/unixpickle/jsbuild) installed in order to use the build script, [build.sh](build.sh).

# TODO

 * Implement blurbs
   * Test blurbs with stretching
   * Implement blurbs for dot graphs
   * Fix upward opening blurbs; they never seem to have an arrow
 * Figure out how alternating x-axis labels will work
 * Implement YLCV subclass for x-axis labels
