# Documentation

This will walk you through the basic architecture of graphalicious. You should read the documents in the following order:

 * [DataSource](DATA_SOURCE.md) - the structure of underlying data and its source.
 * [ContentView](CONTENT_VIEW.md) - the top-level view for displaying graph content
 * [ChunkView](CHUNK_VIEW.md) - the lowest-level view for displaying graph content
 * [ViewProvider](VIEW_PROVIDER.md) - the intermediary between *ContentView* and *ChunkView*.
