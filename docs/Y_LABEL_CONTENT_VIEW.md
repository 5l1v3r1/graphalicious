# Abstract

Pretty much all graphable data is meaningless without some kind of axis labels. In most cases, however, x-axis labels are not very informative while y-axis labels are essential. Because of this realization, graphalicious provides a suite of [ContentView](CONTENT_VIEW.md)s which show y-axis labels.

A *YLabelContentView* (YLCV) is a concrete [ContentView](CONTENT_VIEW.md) implementation which takes care of a bunch of UI-level rendering problems. Its jobs include rendering loading animations and splash screens, lazily loading content, and displaying dynamic y-axis labels.
