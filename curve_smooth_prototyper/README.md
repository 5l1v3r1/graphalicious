# Prototyper

This is a small Go program that I wrote for experimentation purposes. It demonstrates several different graph smoothing techniques.

# Usage

If you really feel the need to run this, you must have the Go programming language installed. You must also have my [gogui](https://github.com/unixpickle/gogui) package, which you can install like this (once you have Go):

    go get https://github.com/unixpickle/gogui
    go install https://github.com/unixpickle/gogui

Finally, you can run the program like this:

    go run *.go

There are also a few [pragmash](https://github.com/unixpickle/pragmash) programs lying around beacuse I love to flex my pragmash muscles. These programs generate code and do nothing on their own.
